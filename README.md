Homebrew Tap
========
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a package manager for Mac OS X.

[Cask](http://caskroom.io/)s provide a way to extend the available packages to
include binary installations.

These are my alternate formulae and my [alternate Cask
tap](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/alternate_cask_taps.md)
for my own non-standard packages.

To use:

    `brew tap SethMilliken/alt`
